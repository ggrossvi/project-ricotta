# Project Ricotta

Project Ricotta is a volunteer effort to build a new web and mobile platform for [Lasagna Love](https://www.lasagnalove.org) volunteers. Project Ricotta is designed to scale kindness by building the digital tools to support Lasagna Love chefs, recipients, and donors in contributing to sharing lasagnas between neighbors.

Project Ricotta is constructing and managing the portal, website, data stack, and infrastructure to improve the Lasagna Love volunteer and requester experience. In addition, it offers a chance for individuals who are either new to open source software development, looking to enhance their software development abilities, or simply interested in participating in a meaningful project, to collaborate with a welcoming, open-minded, and cooperative team.

You can join Project Ricotta as a developer, product manager, or ops engineer. We’ve got three classes of contributors: contributors, maintainers, and mentors.

Mentors manage office hours, support our hackathons, and provide guidance to the project and its members. Maintainers lead the development of a specific component of the Project Ricotta experience, and make the final call on architecture and performance. Contributors are the backbone of Project Ricotta, and pick up and work on the tickets required to build and operate Project Ricotta.

Need more help? Join our open office hours, which are currently Friday evenings, starting March 24th, from 4-8 ET.
